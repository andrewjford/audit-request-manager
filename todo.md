Notes
- why are my activerecord queries not returning in order by id? ex: request.comments
- is it best practice to have hidden inputs in form, or add inputs in through controller?
- is it better to use ActiveRecord queries to scope index or just do it manually
in the controller with activerecord model associations?

Anyone ever run into an issue with activerecord not ordering collections properly? For instance if you call Comment.all and activerecord returns a collection that is not ordered by id. I think it relates to deleted records, because newly added comments were being inserted into the slots of deleted comments.
